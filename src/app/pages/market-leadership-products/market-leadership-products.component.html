                <p>Market leadership is the position of a company with the largest market share or highest profitability
                    margin in a given market for goods and services. Market share may be measured by either the volume
                    of goods sold or the value of those goods.

                    A market leader represents minimal purchasing risk. When companies are making buying decisions, they
                    like to minimize risk. Buying from a market leader reduces risk because a large number of other
                    customers have chosen and successfully used the company’s products, according to the IPO Group. The
                    phrase “nobody ever got fired for buying from IBM” summarizes that characteristic of market leaders.

                <p> <i class="fa fa-angle-double-right"></i> A market leader enjoys high levels of awareness among
                    purchasing decision makers. Market leaders use high levels of advertising and marketing
                    communications to build the strength of their brand. The high level of exposure can help to ensure
                    that they are considered when customers are considering suppliers for their next purchase. High
                    awareness also helps leaders to control their marketing costs compared with competitors who would
                    have to invest much more to gain share.

                    Customers expect that market-leading products meet the highest technical standard and comply with

                    Pauley Creative. Market leaders build that trust by participating in setting industry standards,
                    publishing authoritative technical papers, speaking at industry conferences and collaborating with
                    customers on technical issues.

Leaders attract high-quality development partners who work with them to develop new products or improve existing ones. Development partners see opportunities to gain access to a large market and acquire the kudos of working with a market leader. Leaders can also build a strong distribution network by attracting the leading channel partners in their sectors. Channel partners see opportunities for significant revenue gain
