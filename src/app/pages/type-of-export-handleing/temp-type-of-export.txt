                <p> <i class="fa fa-angle-double-right"></i>
                    Marine insurance definition refers to the insurance of goods dispatched from the country of origin
                    to the country of destination. The term originates from the fact that goods intended for
                    international trade were traditionally transported by sea. Despite what the name implies, marine
                    insurance is applicable to all modes of transportation of goods. When the goods are sent by air,
                    their insurance is also known as marine cargo insurance.

                <h2 style="text-align: center;font-size: 28px;">How Marine Insurance works? </h2>
                <div class="row">
                    <div class="col-md-3">
                        <img src="assets/images/insu.jpg">

                    <div class="col-md-9">

                        Marine insurance transfers the liability of the goods from the parties and intermediaries
                        involved to the insurance company. The legal liability of the intermediaries handling the goods
                        is limited to begin with. The exporter, instead of bearing the sole responsibility of the goods,
                        can buy an insurance policy and get coverage for the exported goods against any possible loss or
                        damage.

                        The carrier of the goods, be it the airline or the shipping company, may bear the cost of
                        damages and losses to the goods while on board. However, the compensation agreed upon is mostly
                        on a ‘per package’ or ‘per consignment’ basis. The coverage so provided may not be sufficient to
                        cover the cost of the goods shipped. Therefore, exporters prefer to ship their products after
                        getting it insured the same with an insurance company.

                        Marine insurance is necessary to meet the contractual obligations of exports. To align with
                        agreements such as cost insurance and freight (CIF) or carriage and insurance paid (CIP), the
                        exporter needs to take marine insurance to protect the buyer’s or their bank’s interest and
                        honor the contractual obligation. Similarly, in the case of Delivered Duty Unpaid (DDU) and
                        Delivered Duty Paid (DDP) terms, the seller may not be obligated to insure the goods, although
                        in practice they generally do.

                <p>In freight insurance, if the goods are damaged in transit, the operator would lose freight
                    receivables & so the insurance will be provided on compensation for loss of freight. </p>
                <h6> <i class="fa fa-angle-double-right"></i>Liability Insurance</h6>
                <p>Marine Liability insurance is where compensation is bought to provide any liability occurring on

                <h6> <i class="fa fa-angle-double-right"></i>Floating policy </h6>
                <p>Large exporters may opt for an open policy, also known as a blanket policy, instead of taking
                    insurance separately for each shipment. An open policy is a one-time insurance that provides
                    insurance cover against all shipments made during the agreed period, often a year. The exporter may
                    need to declare periodically (say, once a month) the detail of all shipments made during the period,
                    type of goods, modes of transport, destinations, etc.</p>
                <h6> <i class="fa fa-angle-double-right"></i>Voyage policy</h6>
                <p>A specific policy can be taken for a single lot or consignment only. The exporter needs to purchase
                    insurance cover every time a shipment is sent overseas. The drawback is that extra effort and time
                    is involved each time an exporter sends a consignment. With open policies, on the other hand,
                    shipments are insured automatically.</p>
                <h6> <i class="fa fa-angle-double-right"></i>Time policy </h6>
                <p>Time policy is generally issued for a year’s period. One can issue for more than a year or they may
                    extend to complete a specific voyage. But it is normally for a fixed period. Also under marine
                    insurance in India, time policy can be issued only once a year.</p>
                <h6> <i class="fa fa-angle-double-right"></i>Mixed policy</h6>
                <p>Mixed policy is a mixture of two policies i.e Voyage policy and Time policy. </p>
                <h6> <i class="fa fa-angle-double-right"></i>Named policy</h6>
                <p>Named policy is one of the most popular policies in marine insurance policy. The name of the ship is
                    mentioned in the insurance document, stating the policy issued is in the name of the ship.</p>
                <h6> <i class="fa fa-angle-double-right"></i>Port Risk policy</h6>
                <p>It is a policy taken to ensure the safety of the ship when it is stationed in a port.</p>
                <h6> <i class="fa fa-angle-double-right"></i>Fleet policy</h6>
                <p>Several ships belonging to the company/owner are covered under one policy. Where it has the advantage
                    of covering even the old ships. Also the policy is a time based policy. </p>
                <h6> <i class="fa fa-angle-double-right"></i>Single Vessel policy</h6>
                <p>In single vessel policy only one vessel is covered under marine insurance policy. </p>
                <h6> <i class="fa fa-angle-double-right"></i>Blanket policy</h6>
                <p>In this policy, the owner has to pay the maximum protection amount at the time of buying the policy.
